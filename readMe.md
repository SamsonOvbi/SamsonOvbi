Hello ,I am [SamsonOvbi](https://github.com/SamsonOvbi).

Professional Front-end Developer, who loves testing his SPA on backend server for features, performance and responsiveness before deploying.

His Web Apps are responsive, adaptive, modular, configurable and scalable by design. 

They are mostly built so that components and modules are reconfigurable to allow  plugging into a framework of choice at the point in time. 

His SPAs have been built using Angular8 and Vanilla-js, with ReactJS, AngularJS and VueJS implementations lined up. 

All tested using NodeJS with appropriate testing, bundling and automatic documentation frameworks of course.
